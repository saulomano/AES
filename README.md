# AES
Migrated Visual Basic AES crypt/decrypt function to Java
Two functions that encrypt/decrypt strings as the original visual basic code pasted below.

Technical solution:
Solution provided is J2SE, and it uses javax.crypto and java.security packages. Solution runs with JDK 8+. You don't need any J2EE library for run it. Solution requires JCE and an Apache library.

Just for curiosity the original visual basic code has a bug. The position 15 of the array hash is overwritten, and the last one (position 31) is never written. I will keep this bug in my java code, because if not the functions will not work as visual basic ones.

Array.Copy(temp, 0, hash, 0, 16) > Here you write from 0 to 15 position (16 characters)
Array.Copy(temp, 0, hash, 15, 16) > Here is the bug. You start writing in position 15 instead of 16.

Original visual basic code:
